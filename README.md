# Insider Dev Tour 2018

Welcome to the content repository for the Insider Dev Tour 2018. Here you will find the content presented at ths year's event. The content was organized and presented in multiple sessions. The 90-minute opening session covered numerous features across Azure and Microsoft 365. The six afternoon sessions dove deeper into specific technologies.

## Afternoon Sessions

Each session is designed to be presented in a 30 minute slot.

### Modernize your Existing Apps for Windows 10
Developers have been relying on Win32, WPF and WinForms to build complex applications, and millions of new projects are created using these same technologies today. UWP is a great technology to build new modern applications on Windows 10 but rewriting an application from scratch is always a tough decision. In this session you’ll learn how you can keep your existing assets, leverage MSIX for safer and reliable deployment, start adding modern features and controls to your applications at your own pace to leverage the power of Windows 10 and make your users more productive today.

### Get the Most Out of your Web App With a PWA
As web developers, we have used JavaScript /HTML to develop fantastic apps of all kinds, but until recently there has been a divide between what can be done with a web app and a native app. A new class of apps called Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) is helping bridge that gap by enabling extremely native-like features in our Web Apps: offline functionality, background activity, native API layers and even app store listings. We’ll show you how Web developers can take their code meant for the browser, and extend it to become cross-platform, Progressive Web Apps.

### Create Productive Apps with Office 365
Office 365 provides the core creative tools for over 120 million monthly active users -- and while there are many amazing capabilities within it, you can dramatically increase the effectiveness and productivity of users by tailoring the apps to roles or tasks. From deep web extensions across Office products to new ways to extend conversations in Microsoft Teams, see key ways to make your users more productive and effective by integrating with Office 365.

### Drive User Engagement Across All Your Devices with Microsoft Graph
Learn how you can build experiences that work for users across Windows, iOS, Android, and more. Microsoft Graph enables smart contextual experiences, user insights, and advanced features like pick up where you left off and timeline integration. Microsoft Graph is the intelligence that can connect your applications.

### Get Started with Machine Learning
Machine Learning has moved out of the lab and into production systems. Understanding how to work with this technology is one of the essential skills for developers today. In this session, you will learn the basics of machine learning, how to use existing models and services in your apps, and how to get started with creating your own simple models.

### Build Mixed Reality Apps
Virtual and Augmented Reality have incredible potential to enhance how we work, play and learn. The Windows Mixed Reality platform combines AR and VR into a single API set for developers and provides maximum reach by making spatial computing available to mainstream devices. In this session you will learn how to build a highly immersive mixed reality experience, using Unity, that can run on multiple devices.
